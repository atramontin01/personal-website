              so yeah, i'm angel. i love making things that look good and work well. 
              whether it's designing something from scratch or coding up a new idea, 
              i'm all about keeping things simple but effective.

              when i'm not glued to my screen, i'm probably trying out some new tech, 
              binge-watching something on netflix, or grabbing coffee and pretending 
              i know what i'm doing with my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              i'm a big fan of keeping things minimal â€“ why complicate stuff when 
              simple just works better?
