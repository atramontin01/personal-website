              i'm currently pursuing my mba at uc berkeley's haas school of business, taking a two-year hiatus from big-tech corporate life to fully immerse myself in the areas that excite me most: startups, ai, sports, wellness, and the many intersections among them.

              as a first-generation american, raised by venezuelan immigrants whose own parents came from lebanon and italy, my identity is deeply rooted in the confluence of multiple worlds. this upbringing instilled in me a profound appreciation for new ideas, diverse people, and unfamiliar places.

              i'm also a community builder, athlete, tech enthusiast, and avid traveler.

              i'm living in sf right now. you can probably catch me biking up hawk hill, grabbing breakfast burritos in the mission, or enjoying sunny days at dolores park.
